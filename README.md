# Healthcare-treatment-polcy-learning
This project builds a complete Reinforcement Learning–based healthcare decision support system. Using synthetic patient data, a DDPG agent learns how to recommend treatment actions that maximize patient stability and long-term outcomes. The project also includes an interactive Streamlit dashboard for visualizing patient vitals.
